# Set Up an App Dev Environment on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

## Your challenge

You are asked to help a newly formed development team with some of their initial work on a new project around storing and organizing photographs, called Memories. You have been asked to assist the Memories team with initial configuration for their application development environment.

You receive the following request to complete the following tasks:

Create a bucket for storing the photographs.
Create a Pub/Sub topic that will be used by a Cloud Run Function you create.
Create a Cloud Run Function.
Remove the previous cloud engineer’s access from the memories project.
Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

Create all resources in the REGION region and ZONE zone, unless otherwise directed.
Use the project VPCs.
Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named kraken-webserver1
Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, use e2-micro for small Linux VMs and e2-medium for Windows or other applications such as Kubernetes nodes.
Each task is described in detail below, good luck!

## Tasks

### Task 0: Environment Setup
```angular2html
# Variables
export USER_2='student-04-66f7daa23e69@qwiklabs.net'
export REGION='us-east4'
export ZONE='us-east4-a'
export BUCKETNAME='qwiklabs-gcp-01-6a8b8e77fed9-bucket'
export TOPIC='topic-memories-270'

# Enable APIs
gcloud services enable \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  eventarc.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  logging.googleapis.com \
  pubsub.googleapis.com

```
Task 1. Create a bucket

You need to create a bucket called Bucket Name for the storage of the photographs. Ensure the resource is created in the REGION region and ZONE zone.

`gcloud storage buckets create gs://${BUCKETNAME} --location=${REGION}`

Task 2. Create a Pub/Sub topic

Create a Pub/Sub topic called Topic Name for the Cloud Run Function to send messages.

`gcloud pubsub topics create ${TOPIC}`


Task 3. Create the thumbnail Cloud Run Function

Create the function

Create a Cloud Run Function Cloud Run Function Name that will to create a thumbnail from an image added to the Bucket Name bucket.

Ensure the Cloud Run Function is using the Cloud Run function environment (which is 2nd generation). Ensure the resource is created in the REGION region and ZONE zone.

Create a Cloud Run Function (2nd generation) called Cloud Run Function Name using Node.js 22.
Note: The Cloud Run Function is required to execute every time an object is created in the bucket created in Task 1. During the process, Cloud Run Function may request permission to enable APIs or request permission to grant roles to service accounts. Please enable each of the required APIs and grant roles as requested.
Make sure you set the Entry point (Function to execute) to Cloud Run Function Name and Trigger to Cloud Storage.
