# Securing Virtual Machines using Chrome Enterprise Premium

## Your challenge

In this lab, you will learn how to use Chrome Enterprise Premium and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) TCP forwarding to enable administrative access to VM instances that do not have external IP addresses or do not permit direct access over the internet.

What you'll learn

Enable IAP TCP forwarding in your Google Cloud project
Test connectivity to your Linux and Windows instances
Configure the required firewall rules for BCE
Grant permissions to use IAP TCP forwarding
Demonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections

## Tasks

#### Task 1. Enable IAP TCP forwarding in your Google Cloud project
```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud services enable iap.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

#### Task 2. Create Linux and Windows instances
```bash
export ZONE='us-east1-d'

gcloud compute instances create linux-iap \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --machine-type=e2-medium \
  --network-interface=network=default,no-address \
  --metadata=enable-oslogin=true \
  --maintenance-policy=MIGRATE \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
  
  gcloud compute instances create windows-iap \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --machine-type=e2-medium \
  --image-project=qwiklabs-resources \
  --image=iap-desktop-v001 \
  --scopes=cloud-platform \
  --network-interface=network=default,no-address \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
  
  gcloud compute instances create windows-connectivity \
  --zone="$ZONE" \
  --machine-type=e2-medium \
  --image-family=windows-2016 \
  --image-project=windows-cloud \
  --scopes=cloud-platform \
  --network-interface=network=default \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```

#### Task 3. Test connectivity to your Linux and Windows instances
```bash
# Verify connectivity; should return error
gcloud compute ssh linux-iap --zone="$ZONE" --project="$PROJECT_ID"
```
#### Task 4. Configure the required firewall rules for BCE
```bash
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-ingress-from-iap \
  --network=default \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --action=ALLOW \
  --rules=tcp:22,tcp:3389 \
  --source-ranges=35.235.240.0/20 \
  --project="$PROJECT_ID"
  
  # Note for some reason, you might need to create this through the gui to pass the checkpoint
```
#### Task 5. Grant permissions to use IAP TCP forwarding
```text
Open Navigation Menu and select Security > Identity-Aware Proxy, switch to the SSH and TCP Resources tab (safely ignore the Oauth Consent screen error in the HTTPS section).
Select the linux-iap and windows-iap VM instances.
Click Add principal, then enter in the service account associated with your Windows connectivity VM. This should be of the form 199615415715-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.
Select Cloud IAP > IAP-Secured Tunnel User for the role.
Click SAVE.
From the top-right of the page click the "S" icon to open your profile and copy the email of the student account.
Click Add principal again to add your student account.
Enter in the student account. You can copy this value from the lab details pane.
Select Cloud IAP > IAP-Secured Tunnel User for the role.
Click SAVE.

```
#### Task 6. Use IAP Desktop to connect to the Windows and Linux instances
```text
To use IAP Desktop to connect to the instances in this lab:

RDP to the windows-connectivity instance by downloading the RDP file. Go to the Compute Engine > VM Instances page. Select the down arrow next to the windows-connectivity instance on the Compute Engine landing page and download the file.

Open the RDP file to connect to the instance via Remote Desktop Protocol. You will use the credentials below to connect to the instance once prompted:

Username: student
Password: Learn123!
Once connected to the windows-connectivity instance, locate and open the IAP Desktop application on the desktop of the instance.

Once the application opens, click on the sign in with Google button to log in. Use the username and password provided in the lab console to authenticate with IAP Desktop. When you're prompted to continue, click Continue, and click Allow.

You will need to add the project to connect to Compute Engine instances within IAP Desktop after authentication. Select the lab project associated with your lab instance:
add_project.png

Double click on the windows-iap instance in the IAP Desktop application to log into the instance.

You may be prompted to provide credentials for the instance the first time you try to connect to it through IAP Desktop. Select "Generate new credentials" the first time logging into the instance.

Click OK for Generate logon credentials popup.

After the credentials are created you will be taken to the desktop of the windows-iap instance and can see the end user experience.

```

#### Task 7. Remonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections
```text
Task 7. Demonstrate tunneling using SSH and RDP connections

You will test connectivity to the RDP instance using an RDP client. This is because you need to connect to the instance via an IAP tunnel locally.

Go to the Compute Engine > VM Instances page.

For the windows-connectivity instance click the down arrow and select Set windows password. Copy the password and save it.

Then click down arrow next to connect and click download the RDP file. Open the RDP file with your client and enter in your password.

Once you have connected to the windows-connectivity instance. Open the Google Cloud Shell SDK:

Google Cloud SDK Shell desktop icon
Now from the command line enter the following command to see if you can connect to the linux-iap instance:

gcloud compute ssh linux-iap

Click Y when prompted to continue and to select the zone.

Make sure that you select the right zone for the instance when prompted.

Then Accept the Putty security alert.

You should receive a message that no external IP address was found and that it will use IAP tunneling.
Output showing external IP address not found

Update Putty Settings to allow Tunnel connections locally. Click the top left corner of the Putty Window > Change Settings.

Putty Settings

Allow local ports to accept connections from other hosts by checking the checkbox "Local ports accept connections from other hosts".

Tunnel Settings

Close the Putty session and click Apply. Use the following command to create an encrypted tunnel to the RDP port of the VM instance:

gcloud compute start-iap-tunnel windows-iap 3389 --local-host-port=localhost:0  --zone=us-east1-d
Copied!
Once you see the message about “Listening on port [XXX].” Copy the tunnel port number.

Return to the Google Cloud Console and go to the Compute Engine > VM Instances page.

Set and copy the password for the windows-iap instance.

Return to the RDP session now.

Leave gcloud running and open the Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Connection app.

Enter the tunnel endpoint where the endpoint is the tunnel port number from the earlier step like so:

localhost:endpoint
Click Connect.

Then enter the previous credentials you copied earlier. You will be successfully RDPed into your instance now!

If prompted click Yes.

You were able to access the instance even without an external IP address using IAP
